# Milestone #2

Milestone 2 implements and tests the `CustomerOrder` module.

The `CustomerOrder` module contains all the functionality for processing customer orders as they move from `Station` to `Station` along the assembly line. The `Station` where a given order currently rests fills a request for one item of that station, if there is any such request. 


## `CustomerOrder` Module

A `CustomerOrder` object manages a single order on the assembly line and contains the following information:

The `CustomerOrder` class has the following structure:

***Item Definition***

```cpp
struct Item
{
	std::string m_itemName;
	size_t m_serialNumber{0};
	bool m_isFilled{false};

	Item(const std::string& src) : m_itemName(src) {};
};
```


***Instance Variables***

- `std::string m_name` – the name of the customer (e.g., John, Sara, etc)
- `std::string m_product` – the name of the product being assembled (e.g., Desktop, Laptop, etc)
- `size_t m_cntItem` – a count of the number of items in the customer's order
- `Item** m_lstItem` – a dynamically allocated array of pointers. Each element of the array points to a dynamically allocated object of type `Item` (see below). **This is the resource** that your class must manage.

***Class Variable***

- `static size_t m_widthField` – the maximum width of a field, used for display purposes

***Member Functions***

- default constructor
- a custom 1-arg constructor that takes a reference to an unmodifiable string.  This constructor uses a local `Utilities` object to extract the tokens from the string and populate the current instance. 
  The fields in the string are (separated by a delimiter):
    - Customer Name
    - Order Name
    - the list of items making up the order (at least one item)
    
  After finishing extraction, this constructor updates `CustomerOrder::m_widthField` if the current value is smaller than the value stored in `Utilities::m_widthField`.
- a `CustomerOrder` object should not allow copy operations.  The copy constructor should throw an exception if called and the copy `operator=` should be deleted.
- a move constructor. This constructor should "promise" that it doesn't throw exceptions. Use the `noexcept` keyword in the declaration and the definition.
- a move assignment operator. This operator should "promise" that it doesn't throw exceptions. Use the `noexcept` keyword in the declaration and the definition.
- a destructor
- `bool isFilled() const` – returns `true` if all the items in the order have been filled; `false` otherwise
- `bool isItemFilled(const std::string& itemName) const` – returns `true` if all items specified by `itemName` have been filled. If the item doesn't exist in the order, this query returns `true`.
- `void fillItem(Station& station, std::ostream& os)` – this modifier fills all items in the current order that the `Station` specified in the first parameter handles.
    - if the order doesn't contain the item handled, this function does nothing
    - if the order contains items handled, and the `Station`'s inventory contains at least one item, this function fills the order with one item. It subtracts 1 from the inventory and updates `Item::m_serialNumber` and `Item::m_isFilled`. It also prints the message `    Filled NAME, PRODUCT [ITEM_NAME]`.
    - if the order contains items handled but unfilled, and the inventory is empty, this function prints the message `    Unable to fill NAME, PRODUCT [ITEM_NAME]`.
    - all messages printed are terminated by an endline
- `void display(std::ostream& os) const` – this query displays the state of the current object in the format (see the sample output for details)
    ```
    CUSTOMER_NAME - PRODUCT
    [SERIAL] ITEM_NAME - STATUS
    [SERIAL] ITEM_NAME - STATUS
    ...
    ```
    - `SERIAL` - a field of width 6
    - `ITEM_NAME` - a field of size `m_widthField`
    - `STATUS` is either `FILLED` or `TO BE FILLED`
    - you must use IO manipulators to format this output.



## Tester Module

The tester module and input files are included in the repository. Do not modify any of them.
